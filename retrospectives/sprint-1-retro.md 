# Overview of the Results of Sprint 1

During Sprint 1, our team successfully developed and launched the initial version of the influencer discovery and engagement platform.
The platform enables groups and businesses to find, connect with, and manage relationships with influencers effectively.
Users can now browse influencer profiles, register, and manage their accounts on the website.

## Findings from Internal Evaluation

Although the platform’s core features have been completed, initial testing and internal evaluations identified several areas that require improvement to ensure consistency and enhance user experience.

### Consistent Symbols

All icons and graphical elements across the platform need to be standardized.
This includes maintaining consistency in size, color scheme, and alignment according to the platform’s branding guidelines.

### Coherence of the Theme

The overall website theme should be refined to achieve a more cohesive visual presentation.
To strengthen brand identity, all pages should use consistent color schemes, typography, and layouts.

### Improvement of the Influencer Registration Page

The influencer registration interface requires adjustments to align better with the platform’s concept and user experience objectives.
Specific improvements will focus on the layout of the form, the clarity of input fields, and responsive design to ensure smooth registration across all devices.

## Next Steps

In the next sprint, the team will implement these improvements and conduct further usability testing.
The objective is to deliver a seamless, consistent, and user-focused platform that fulfills both user needs and business goals.
